#### .env file

Since this boilerplate project is using PostgreSQL, you have to install it for your machine and get a database up and running. You find everything for the set up over here: [Setup PostgreSQL with Sequelize in Express Tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgres-express-setup-tutorial). After you have created a database and a database user, you cann fill out the environment variables in the *server/.env* file.

```
DATABASE=mydatabase
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres

SECRET=asdlplplfwfwefwekwself.2342.dawasdq
```

The `SECRET` is just a random string for your authentication. Keep all these information secure by adding the *.env* file to your *.gitignore* file. No third-party should have access to this information.
